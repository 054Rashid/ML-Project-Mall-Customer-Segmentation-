Customer Segmentation with K-Means & PCA

This project applies unsupervised learning to identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior. Using K-Means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we can visualize and interpret the different customer groups, enabling better marketing and business strategies.

📑 Project Overview

  Objective: Discover distinct customer groups to enable targeted marketing strategies.
  Core Techniques: K-Means Clustering, Elbow Method, Standardization, PCA Visualization.
  Dataset: Mall Customers Dataset from Kaggle.
  Outcome: Segmented customers into 5 groups based on their Annual Income and Spending Score.


🗂️ Workflow

  Load & Explore Data: Understand the structure and key features of the dataset.
  Preprocess Data: Select relevant features and apply scaling (critical for K-Means).
  Determine Optimal Number of Clusters using the Elbow Method.
  Apply K-Means Clustering to group customers.
  Visualize Clusters using scatter plots and PCA.
  Interpret Segments: Turn clusters into actionable business insights.

📁Key Features Used

Annual Income (k$)
Spending Score (1–100)
(Other features like Age can be used for further analysis of segments.)

📈 Exploratory Analysis

Elbow Method Plot: Shows Within-Cluster-Sum-of-Squares (WCSS) vs. k to find optimal clusters.
Scatter Plot of Clusters: Visualizes customer segments by income and spending score.
Centroids: Red markers showing the center of each cluster.

📁 Segments Identified
Segment	Characteristics	Business Insight
0 – Standard	Average income, average spending	Baseline customers
1 – Target (Prime Customers)	High income, high spending	High-value customers to retain
2 – Careful	High income, low spending	Upsell or retarget campaigns
3 – Sensible	Low income, low spending	Low-value customers
4 – Careless	Low income, high spending	Budget-friendly offers

(Segment personas can be refined further by combining Age and other demographic data.)

📁Future Improvements

Include Age, Gender, or other demographics for more nuanced segmentation.
Use PCA to reduce dimensionality when using multiple features.
Experiment with other clustering methods (DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering).

📝 Output

Cluster Labels added to the original dataset.
Visualizations of clusters and centroids.
Segment Analysis Table showing average Age, Income, and Spending Score for each group.
